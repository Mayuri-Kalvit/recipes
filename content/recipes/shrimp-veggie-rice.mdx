## Ingredients
Ingredients (1 serving) with calories and protein

150 g shrimp (peeled, cooked): about 150 calories and 30 g protein

1 cup cooked rice: about 205 calories and 4 g protein

1 cup mixed vegetables: about 50 calories and 2 g protein

1 tbsp ghee or olive oil (total used): about 120 calories and 0 g protein

1 tbsp schezwan chutney: about 35 calories and 0 g protein

1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce: about 50 calories and 0 g protein

Seasoning (salt, pepper, spices): negligible calories and protein

## Instructions
Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the shrimp until fully done. If using frozen shrimp, cook them directly in the pan without oil—the released moisture will cook them. If using thawed shrimp, add ½ tbsp ghee or olive oil. Once cooked, remove shrimp and set aside.

In the same pan, add ½ tbsp ghee or olive oil and sauté your vegetables for 4–5 minutes until tender and fully cooked.

Add cooked rice to the pan, sprinkle in your preferred seasonings, and stir well so the rice is evenly coated and heated through.

Return the shrimp to the pan and mix everything together. Add about 2 tbsp of schezwan chutney and sweet chilli sauce, stir well, and cook for another minute until everything is evenly coated and heated.

Serve hot and enjoy.
