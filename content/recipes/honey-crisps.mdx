## Ingredients
170 g Greek yogurt — about 110 calories, 17 g protein

1 medium apple — about 95 calories, ~0.5 g protein

1 tbsp honey — about 60 calories

Protein powder (optional, 1 scoop) — typically ~80–120 calories and 20–25 g protein depending on brand

## Instructions
Add Greek yogurt to a bowl. If using protein powder, mix it in until smooth and creamy. Add a splash of water or milk if needed to loosen the texture.

Slice the apple into wedges or bite-sized pieces.

Drizzle honey over the yogurt and serve alongside the apple slices. Dip the apple slices into the yogurt mixture and enjoy as a quick, high-protein snack or dessert.
