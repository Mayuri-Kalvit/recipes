## Ingredients
200 g chicken breast — ~330 calories, ~62 g protein
3–4 tbsp Greek yogurt — ~45 calories, ~4 g protein
1 tbsp olive oil — ~120 calories, 0 g protein
½ head broccoli — ~25 calories, ~2 g protein
9–10 baby carrots — ~35 calories, ~1 g protein
½ yellow squash — ~20 calories, ~1 g protein
Seasonings of choice — negligible calories and protein

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 420°F (215°C).

Cut chicken breast into cubes or strips and marinate with Greek yogurt, lime juice, salt, pepper, paprika, and any seasoning of choice. Spread the marinated chicken evenly in a baking dish.

Chop broccoli, carrots, and yellow squash. Place them on a separate baking tray, drizzle olive oil, and season lightly with salt and spices. Toss to coat evenly.

Bake both trays in the oven for 20–25 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and vegetables are tender and lightly roasted.

Serve hot as is, or pair with steamed rice or quinoa if desired.
