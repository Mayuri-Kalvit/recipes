## Ingredients
112 g extra-lean ground turkey (99% lean) — about 120 calories, 26 g protein

1 egg — about 60 calories, 6 g protein

½ onion, finely chopped — about 20 calories

Cilantro (optional) — negligible calories

½ tbsp cornstarch (optional, for texture/crunch) — about 15 calories

20 g sooji (semolina) for coating — about 70 calories

2 Hawaiian buns — about 240 calories, ~6 g protein total

2 tbsp low-fat sour cream — about 50 calories, ~2 g protein

2 cups spring mix greens — about 15 calories

Seasonings of choice

½ tbsp ghee or olive oil for cooking — about 60 calories

## Instructions
In a bowl, mix ground turkey, egg, chopped onion, cilantro, cornstarch, and seasonings until well combined and sticky enough to form patties.

Wet your hands slightly and shape the mixture into burger patties. Coat lightly with semolina (sooji) for a crisp exterior.

Heat a pan over medium heat with ghee or olive oil. Cook patties for about 6–8 minutes total, flipping halfway, until fully cooked and golden brown.

Toast buns in the same pan, spread sour cream on the buns, and assemble the burgers with the patties.

Serve with spring mix salad on the side and enjoy.
