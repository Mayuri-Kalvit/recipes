## Ingredients
120 g pancake batter mix (about 210 calories, 5 g protein; varies by brand)

1 egg (about 60 calories, 6 g protein)

2 scoops protein powder (about 160 calories, 25 g protein; adjust based on brand nutrition)

¾ cup whole milk (about 90 calories, 3 g protein)

1 cup mixed berries (about 50 calories)

4 tbsp whipped cream (about 30 calories)

1 tbsp honey (about 60 calories)

½ tbsp ghee or butter for cooking

## Instructions
In a large bowl, combine pancake mix, egg, milk, and protein powder. Whisk until smooth and lump-free. Adjust with a splash of milk if the batter feels too thick.

Heat a pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with ghee or butter. Pour portions of batter onto the pan; this amount makes about 2–3 medium-sized pancakes.

Cook each pancake for about 2–3 minutes until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown and cooked through.

Stack the pancakes and top with fresh berries, whipped cream, and a drizzle of honey if desired.

Serve warm and enjoy.
