## Ingredients
112 g ground chicken breast — about 110 calories, 24 g protein

1 egg — about 60 calories, 6 g protein

½ onion, finely chopped — about 20 calories

Cilantro (optional) — negligible calories

½ tbsp cornstarch (optional, helps with texture/crunch) — about 15 calories

20 g sooji (semolina) for coating — about 70 calories

2 Hawaiian buns — about 240 calories, ~6 g protein total

2 tbsp low-fat sour cream — about 50 calories, ~2 g protein

2 cups spring mix greens — about 15 calories

Seasonings of choice (salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili flakes, etc.)

½ tbsp ghee or olive oil for cooking — about 60 calories

## Instructions
In a mixing bowl, combine ground chicken, egg, chopped onion, cilantro, cornstarch, and seasonings. Mix well until the mixture becomes sticky and holds together.

Lightly wet your hands and shape the mixture into burger patties. Spread semolina (sooji) on a plate and coat each patty lightly to create a crisp outer layer when cooked.

Heat a pan over medium heat and add ghee or olive oil. Cook the patties for about 6–8 minutes total, flipping halfway, until golden brown and cooked through.

In the same pan, lightly toast the buns. Spread low-fat sour cream on the buns and assemble the burgers with the cooked patties.

Serve with a side of fresh spring mix salad and enjoy.
